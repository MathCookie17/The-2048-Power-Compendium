The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all

If you rerelease this Software publicly, especially in an altered form,
you must clearly indicate that the Software is not the original version.
For example, if you release a copy of the Software with new modes added, 
you may call it "The 2048 Power Compendium Plus" or "The 2048 Power Compendium Modified"
or really any other name that indicates it's not the original 2048 Power Compendium, 
but don't just call it "The 2048 Power Compendium".
You may recreate individual modes without having to rename them - 
for example, if you recreate the 2047 mode as a standalone project, you are free to just call it
"2047" - the renaming clause only applies to the name "The 2048 Power Compendium" itself, not to its
individual modes.
