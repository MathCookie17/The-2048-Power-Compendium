    Tiles are stored as arrays of numbers. For example, in 2048, tiles are arrays containing a single number, which is log2 of the tile's number, so a 4 is [2] and

    so [4, 2] in 2187 is a 3^4 * 2 = 162 tile, while [1, 3] in 4096 is a 8^1 * 3 = 24 tile. TileNumAmount is the amount of entries in such an array for the current
    gamemode. TileTypes is an array where each entry corresponds one type of tile; within each entry, the 0th entry is either the array of that tile or a CalcArray
    expression that, if it evaluates to true, indicates that the tile should use that entry of TileTypes, the 1st entry is the text on the tile, the 2nd entry

    CalcArrays, in their most basic form, are something like [2, "+", 3, "*", 5]. The CalcArray function evaluates a CalcArray into its result, working from left
    to right: for example, [2, "+", 3, "*", 5] = [5, "*", 5] = 25. What makes these useful is that they can use properties of the tiles they're working with in
    TileTypes and MergeRules: for example, ["@This 0", "*", 2] evaluates to double the 0th number of that tile's internal representation, so for a 162 tile in 2187,
    which internally is a [4, 2] tile, ["@This 0", "*", 2] evaluates to 8. CalcArrays can work with numbers, strings, booleans, bigints, and other arrays -
    but avoid using the @ character in strings if you want to work with them as strings, as strings beginning with @ mean special things, as seen in CalcArrayString.
    With all the features that CalcArrays support, they're almost a miniature programming language...

    /*
    List of script types:
        BeginTurn: Executes at the beginning of each turn
        EndTurn: Executes at the end of each turn
        StayStill: Executes before EndMovement scripts on a staying still movement (vdir and hdir are both 0 and/or slideAmount is 0)
        MoveIteration: Executes after each "slide", i.e. after every tile that's going to move moves one move in the direction of movement
        TileMove: Executes whenever a tile moves
        Merge: Executes whenever a merge occurs (not including length-0 merges). If @var-retain or @var-copy is included, then the variables of the merge rule are included, and one more variable comes after them, that being an array of the tiles resulting from the merge.
        EndMovement: Executes when the movement of that turn finishes, but before length-0 merges
        EndMovementDirection: Executes right before the EndMovement scripts; unlike the EndMovement scripts, these can trigger even on automatic moves that don't trigger beginning/end scripts
        PossibleEnd: Executes when the movement of that turn is about to finish; if there are any of these scripts, the end of the turn is postponed in case tiles can still move after the script (the turn then ends if no tiles move directly afterwards)
        PreSpawn: Executes right before the new random tiles spawn; will not execute if spawnConditions evaluates to false this turn
        PostSpawn: Executes right after the new random tiles spawn; will not execute if spawnConditions evaluates to false this turn. For these scripts, if @var_retain or @var_copy is included, "@Var 0" is an array of the tiles that were just spawned.
        ZeroMerge: Executes whenever a length-0 merge occurs
        PossibleOver: Executes when it's about to be Game Over: if there are any of these scripts, the Game Over is postponed in case it's not quite game over yet (but if there are still no moves left, then it's game over for real)
        Victory: Executes upon winning (right before the win screen pops up)
        GameOver: Executes upon Game Over (right before the Game Over screen pops up)
        TrueEndTurn: Executes at the very end of the turn, after all the win condition stuff is checked (but before Victory or GameOver scripts).
        None: Is not triggered automatically, but can still be called directly in CalcArray expressions (this is true of any type that aren't the ones listed above, but "None" is the recommended way to denote this)
