# The 2048 Power Compendium
[Link to the game](https://mathcookie17.github.io/The-2048-Power-Compendium/)

The 2048 Power Compendium is a collection of 61 different variations of 2048. Some of these are based on powers of different numbers: 2048 is based on powers of 2, 2187 is based on powers of 3, 1024 is based on powers of 4, 3125 is based on powers of 5, and so on. Some of these variations are based on powers of numbers offset by some other value, such as 2047 (powers of 2, minus 1) and 2059 (powers of 3, minus powers of 2). The main 25 modes tend to follow these patterns, but the 36 extra modes don't.

In addition to the 61 variants, there are also a bunch of modifiers which can be used to alter every gamemode, such as changing the size of the grid, changing the amount of tiles that spawn at once, adding holes to the grid, and much more.

Any requests/ideas for 2048 variants to add to the Compendium? Email me at mathcookie17@gmail.com if you want to give me any ideas.

This project is released under the MIT License, which I chose for two reasons: because both the original 2048 and *he* are released under the MIT License, and because I feel people should be able to do what they want with the 2048 variants in this project. I do, however, request that you not rerelease the 2048 Power Compendium as a whole. I'm fine with people recreating individual variants from the Compendium, since the 2048 community is very open-source to begin with, but please don't just copy the whole project without discussing it with me first (making a temporary copy for the purpose of a pull request is fine, as long as the copy is deleted once the request is merged or cancelled). I can't *stop* you because of the MIT license, but I'd really like it if you get permission from me first as far as copying the whole Compendium over to somewhere else goes. Again, do what you will with the ideas and gameplay of individual variants, modifiers, etc., but as far as the actual code of the Compendium goes, I'd prefer it if you ask for permission first so I know what you want to do with it.
